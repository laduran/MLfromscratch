The series shows how to implement the following algorithms using just Numpy or basic
Python math functions:

1) K-Nearest Neighbors
2) Linear Regression
3) Logistic Regression
4) Decision Trees
5) Random Forest
6) Naive Bayes
7) Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
8) Perceptron (from neural net)
9) Support Vector Machine (SVM)
10) K-Means

Some additional basic linear algebra is in the Notebook: some_linear_algebra.ipynb
